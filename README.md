# 100 Days of Code

Welcome üëãüèø to my Repo for my various learnings throughout the 100 Days of code challenge days 1-10 I've already completed on LinkedIn. 
From Day 11 onwards I'll add relevant links, code snippets and images.

## Tue Nov 15th 2022 Day 16
Went to a freecodecamp  meetup in London. I really enjoyed meeting more devs who were so  passionate about the different projects they were working on. Found out about OBLIQ Protocol who are building a GBP stablecoin. Which is a project I am looking forward to following and would love to contribute towards when they release their product. Populated some more info on my portfolio website and made more styling changes.


## Mon Nov 14th 2022 Day 15 
Missed a couple of days as I prioritised interview prep. Today got an initial working solution to the codewars kata I was working on.  Will be  refactoring it and then submitting. Plus continued making some styling changes to my portfolio website and ensuring responsive styles between next image and tailwind. As well as making sure that next/image was correctly configured.
  
## Wed Nov 9th 2022 Day 14
Added the final component for the v1 of my portfolio website now I plan to do some refactoring so my code looks decent and add all the relevant text/ images. Also did some soft skills interview preparation.

## Tue Nov 8th 2022 Day 13
Edited the style of my projects page carousel component to cycle through  cards instead of images and to use arrow buttons, started on a codewars problem that was based on the Fibonacci sequence. Plus spent time on dev job applications.

## Mon Nov 7th 2022 Day 12
Added a carousel component to my portfolio website for my projects. Spent the rest of the day on job applications and improving my CV based on feedback.
Read and took notes on this article on [How not to learn TypeScript](https://fettblog.eu/how-not-to-learn-typescript/). If I can avoid making easy errors it can save me a lot of time and frustration in the future.
