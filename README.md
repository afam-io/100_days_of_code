# 100 Days of Code

Welcome 👋🏿 to my Repo for my various learnings throughout the 100 Days of code challenge days 1-10 I've already completed on LinkedIn. 
From Day 11 onwards I'll add relevant links, code snippets and images.

## Mon Nov 7th 2022 Day 11
Added a carousel component to my portfolio website for my projects. Spent the rest of the day on job applications and improving my CV based on feedback.
