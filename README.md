# 100 Days of Code

Welcome üëãüèø to my Repo for my various learnings throughout the 100 Days of code challenge days 1-10 I've already completed on LinkedIn. 
From Day 11 onwards I'll add relevant links, code snippets and images.

## Wed Nov 9th 2022 Day 14
	Added the final component for the v1 of my portfolio website now I plan to do some refactoring so my code looks decent and add all the relevant text/ images. Also did some soft skills interview preparation.

## Tue Nov 8th 2022 Day 13
Edited the style of my projects page carousel component to cycle through  cards instead of images and to use arrow buttons, started on a codewars problem that was based on the Fibonacci sequence. Plus spent time on dev job applications.

## Mon Nov 7th 2022 Day 12
Added a carousel component to my portfolio website for my projects. Spent the rest of the day on job applications and improving my CV based on feedback.
Read and took notes on this article on [How not to learn TypeScript](https://fettblog.eu/how-not-to-learn-typescript/). If I can avoid making easy errors it can save me a lot of time and frustration in the future.
