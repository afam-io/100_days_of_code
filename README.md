# 100 Days of Code

Welcome 👋🏿 to my Repo for my various learnings throughout the 100 Days of code challenge days 1-10 I've already completed on LinkedIn. 
From Day 11 onwards I'll add relevant links, code snippets and images.

## Mon Nov 7th 2022 Day 12
Added a carousel component to my portfolio website for my projects. Spent the rest of the day on job applications and improving my CV based on feedback.
Read and took notes on this article on [How not to learn TypeScript](https://fettblog.eu/how-not-to-learn-typescript/). If I can avoid making easy errors it can save me a lot of time and frustration in the future.
